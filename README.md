Challenge B: SQL Database Challenge

Define a relational database to model a simple auction website given the following
description:

“An auction allows customers to place bids on ‘lots’. Lots are products available for sale. The
highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the lot, providing the seller’s reserve has been
met.”

As part of the challenge, you should:

1. Identify the tables and some useful fields required to capture relevant basic data for
   the auction website as per the description above. Hint – you should not need more
   than five tables.

2. Draw the entity relationship model for the database taking care to highlight the
   fields, data-types, relationships between tables and any primary or foreign keys.

3. Write SQL statements to define your tables, and use them to create a database on a
   platform of your choice ( e.g. sqlite, MySQL ).

4. Add some test data to the database.

5. Write some SQL to report on the highest bidder’s details such that it can be queried
   or organised by auction.
